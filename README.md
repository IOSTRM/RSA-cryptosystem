# RSA-cryptosystem

There is a first version of an implementation of RSA-cryptosystem in haskell. 

# Instructions
There are 3 files for this program. To run each of them, firstly run :l name_of_file.hs. key-gen.hs works as following: when you call key-gen method from it you will see the message that key is generated, and after it is generated, you will see a corresponding message. For the creation of keys, I take prime numbers in a range (2^100, 2^112), which are pretty big. I could take a bigger interval, but then key generation would take a lot of time.
