# RSA-cryptosystem

There is a third version of an implementation of RSA-cryptosystem in haskell. 

# Instructions
So, now program works via the command line. There are three arguments which you need: -gen-keys - generates keys; -encrypt - encrypts the message in the given file; -decrypt - decrypts the message.

# keyGen
Works as previuosly, no changes made, it just generates keys.

# encrypt 
Type encrypt and then print the name of file, which contains the text which you want to encrypt. Afterall, it will show a number which stands for a decrypted text.

# decrypt
Just write the number, which you got from encrypt or any else, and it will print out the text as it looks in the file.
