# RSA-cryptosystem

There is a third version of an implementation of RSA-cryptosystem in haskell. 

# Instructions
So, now program works via the command line. There are three arguments which you need: -gen-keys - generates keys; -encrypt - encrypts the message in the given file; -decrypt - decrypts the message.

# keyGen
Works as previuosly, no changes made, it just generates keys.

# encrypt 
Yow will see a text "enter a name of the file: ", after which you can type in the name of your file. After the message is encrypted, you will see the text "encrypted message: " and the encryption below.

# decrypt
Works similarly as -encrypt.
