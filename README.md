# RSA-cryptosystem

There is a first version of an implementation of RSA-cryptosystem in haskell. 

# Instructions
So, I have totally changed how program works. There is one main file, called main.hs. It contains functions such as keyGen which generates keys, encrypt - encryption and decrypt - decryption. To execute any function simly call :l main.hs in ghci and then type keyGen, encrypt or decrypt. 

# keyGen
Works as previuosly, no changes made, it just generates keys.

# encrypt 
Type encrypt and then print the name of file, which contains the text which you want to encrypt. Afterall, it will show a number which stands for a decrypted text.

# decrypt
Just write the number, which you got from encrypt or any else, and it will print out the text as it looks in the file.
